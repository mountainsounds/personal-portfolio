               Growing up in rural Vermont, I enjoyed New England's simple pleasures and more maple syrup than is probably good for one. While attaining a degree in Philosophy, far from the hills and granite cliffs of home, I became a climber. Upon graduating, I pursued training and certification with the American Mountain Guides Association and began to teach, coach, and guide new and experienced climbers alike throughout the U.S.

                Teaching others to climb, I realized that learning any new skill simply required time, diligent practice, and effective teaching. I began to think about fresh, professional possibilities, and fell upon software development. Solving a bug, or attempting to implement an idea reminded me of the process of succeeding on a hard climb. It required a similar mix of methodical approach, personal style, and often, simply a good night's sleep!

                While eagerly exploring this new world, my learning was motivated by building applications that merged these two passions together: climbing and coding. My exposure to software engineering has kindled a broader, more universal desire as well: to address problems and bring some order to a chaotic world, hopefully enriching lives in the process.

                I hope you enjoy your time here, and please don't hesitate to get in touch to chat, collaborate, or even spend a few hours climbing happily over warm rock!
